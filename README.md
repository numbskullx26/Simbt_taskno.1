<br>

<p>The Fraud Email Detection project is an application of machine learning that aims to identify and flag fraudulent emails, particularly those that attempt to scam or deceive individuals or organizations for financial gain. The project uses a machine learning model based on the logistic regression algorithm to analyze the text content of incoming emails and determine the likelihood that they are fraudulent.</p>

<h2 align="center">Chain of Events:</h1>

<p>The fraud email detection project involves several stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Collection</li>
  <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
  <li>Feature Extraction</li>
  <li>Model Training</li>
  <li>Model Evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p/>During the data collection stage, a large dataset of emails that have been labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent is gathered. This dataset is then preprocessed to remove irrelevant or redundant information and prepare it for analysis.</p>
