<br>

<p>The Fraud Email Detection project is an application of machine learning that aims to identify and flag fraudulent emails, particularly those that attempt to scam or deceive individuals or organizations for financial gain. The project uses a machine learning model based on the logistic regression algorithm to analyze the text content of incoming emails and determine the likelihood that they are fraudulent.</p>

<p>The Fraud Email Detection project is an application of machine learning that aims to identify and flag fraudulent emails, particularly those that attempt to scam or deceive individuals or organizations for financial gain. The project uses a machine learning model based on the logistic regression algorithm to analyze the text content of incoming emails and determine the likelihood that they are fraudulent.</p>


<h2 align="center">Chain of Events:</h1>

<p>The fraud email detection project involves several stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Collection</li>
  <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
  <li>Feature Extraction</li>
  <li>Model Training</li>
  <li>Model Evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p/>During the data collection stage, a large dataset of emails that have been labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent is gathered. This dataset is then preprocessed to remove irrelevant or redundant information and prepare it for analysis.</p>


<p>The logistic regression model is then trained on this preprocessed dataset, using the extracted features as input variables. The model learns to classify emails as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on the patterns it observes in the input data.</p>

<p>Finally, the model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to measure its performance in accurately detecting fraudulent emails. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score may be used to assess the model's performance.</p>

<p>Overall, the Fraud Email Detection project is an important application of machine learning that can help protect individuals and organizations from falling victim to fraudulent emails. By leveraging the power of logistic regression, the project is able to accurately and efficiently identify potential fraud, enabling users to take appropriate action to protect themselves from harm.</p>
